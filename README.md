# Watch_or_Not
 This is my front end development projet for Code Louisville.  The website that I have created is for my podcast Watch or not with Jay and MJ.  The requriments that I have met are 
 1. A responsive navigation that moves from vertical layout on smaller screens to horizontal on larger.
 2. I have created a contact form that validates the name submitted and produces an alert pop up with your name, thanking you for your submision.
 3. For my extra features I have added CSS grid layout on the episodes page that will move to the proper coulmns layout needed upon resizing, and I have added javascript read more buttons for each episode.
