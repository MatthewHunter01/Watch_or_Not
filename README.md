# Watch_or_Not
 This is my front end development projet for Code Louisville.  The website that I have created is for my podcast Watch or not with Jay and MJ.  I have included an adjustable navigation bar that will resize and move based on screen size, the contact form will have a pop up upon clicking the submit button, the episodes page is built with CSS grid layout so that it will fill and create the needed amount of columns needed based on screen size, and the descriptions for each episodd are hidden by a read more selector.
