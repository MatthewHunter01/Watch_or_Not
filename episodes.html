            <h4 class="title">4. #BlackAF</h4>
            <p>MJ is proving to be just as lazy as Jay by watching more TV. Jay discovers new pop music...that's 3 years old. 
                The guys launch into a conversation about #BlackAF. It gets a little deep this week people but it's in the interest of learning from each other. 
                Also, MJ was worried about sounding stupid talking about a black themed show so, give him shit about it.</p>

            <p>Jay can't stop clicking on litsticles and quizzes - guess he really needs to know if picking his favorite flower will reveal which 
                Marvel Superhero should be his bae. MJ is continuing to make Jay look like a slacker by teaching himself how to code in his spare time. 
                And we watched Normal People on Hulu so get ready for some full frontal.</p>

            <p>MJ is doing some self care adn Jay is reading...well...listening to books. We get off topic a few times but we discuss the HBO show the Outsider, 
                based on the Stephe King novel. Talking about this gave Jay nightmares 
                for a couple of days but he was still able to anoit a new Bae of the Week.</p>
